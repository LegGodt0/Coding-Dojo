            <h2 id="javascript-basics">JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p class="description-content">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibily for developers to take it in a brunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul class="content-ul">
                <li id="variable-declaration">
                    <p><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="blue-one">var x;</span></p>
                </li>

                <li id="variable-assignment">
                    <p><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving out variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assign a value to a variable. <span class="blue-one">var x= 10;</span></p>
                </li>

                <li id="data-type">
                    <p><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="blue-one">true</span> or <span class="blue-one">false;</span> null - <span class="blue-one">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="blue-one">42</span> or <span class="blue-one">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="blue-one">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="blue-one">[1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="blue-one">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></spa></p>
                </li>

                <li id="conditionals">
                    <p><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="blue-one">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="blue-one">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="blue-one">else</span> we execute this block of code;</p>
                </li>

                <li id="loops">
                    <p><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</p>
                </li>

                <li id="function">
                    <p><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run taht code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call out function over and over and over again.</p>
